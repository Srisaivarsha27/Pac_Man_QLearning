# Deep Convolutional Q-Learning for Pac-Man

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement Deep Convolutional Q-Learning (DQN) for the classic game Pac-Man using a Google Colab notebook. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to setting up the environment, preparing the data, building the model, training it, and evaluating its performance.

## Features

- **Environment Setup**: Instructions to set up the necessary environment and dependencies within Google Colab.
- **Game Environment**: Integration of the Pac-Man game environment for training the DQN model.
- **Model Architecture**: Construction of a deep convolutional neural network to approximate the Q-value function.
- **Training**: Detailed steps to train the DQN model using experience replay and target network.
- **Evaluation**: Methods to evaluate the performance of the trained model in playing Pac-Man.
